# Image Dehazing and Object Detection
This project implements an advanced image dehazing technique using Non-Local Dehazing and Vision Transformer (ViT), combined with YOLOv10 for vehicle detection. It helps in improving visibility in foggy or hazy environments, which is critical for autonomous navigation systems.
The techonologies used 
- Python
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- YOLOv10
- Vision Transformer (ViT)
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
